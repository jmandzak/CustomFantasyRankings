1,Josh Allen,"Josh Allen obviously had a great year last year, propelled by 12 rushing TDs. That many TDs is usually a sign of regression, but he takes 37% of runs from inside of the 5 (2nd highest in the league among QBs) so this number is attainable again. They didn't do much to bolster the receiving room, but another year of chemistry should prove to support at least a similar, if not better, passing outlook. Draft with confidence",Bijan Robinson,"Bijan Robinson is as close to a safe great pick that you can make at running back. Great snap %, great talent, and little competition. He also earned ~4 targets a game last year, and racked up over 400 receiving yards. Getting 70% of the carries from within 5 yards means he's still a good bet for 10+ TDs. Draft with confidence.",Jamarr Chase,"Led the league in targets
Still a horrible defense, #1 option in great offense
Situation hasn't changed. Don't overthink it",Trey Mcbride,"Exact same situation as last year
26.7 pts/100 snap, 16% util, 28% tgt share
All ELITE numbers
Most TE tgts inside 10 yds, only 2 TDs
Will score more next year undoubtedly
Clear path to TE1",,,,
2,Jalen Hurts,"Jalen Hurts is currently going as the 4 or 5 QB, but he has QB1 upside. Hurts was a top option last year despite throwing for less than 3k yards. The tush push lives to see another year and the passing stats can't possibly go down, so I expect a big year for Hurts. Expect more passing and an excellent year.",Jahmyr Gibbs,"While he does split time with Montgomery, when he is on the field the Lions put the ball in his hands and he is electric. Great utilization % and tied with his running mate for most PPR points per 100 snaps. While I do think this offense gets slightly worse compared to last year, Gibbs is an incredible player that is deserving of his high ADP. Plus we've seen that if Monty misses time, Gibbs becomes the best fantasy player we've seen since prime CMC",Ceedee Lamb,"Ceedee Lamb showed last year he could still be a WR1 even without Dak Prescott. He averaged over 10 targets, and finished with 150 targets despite missing a couple games. Dak is back, Parsons is gone, and Pickens is here. Even though Pickens will take way targets, it could let Ceedee line up in the slot more which is great. Post Parsons trade Ceedee is an excellent option",Brock Bowers,"27.5 pts/100 snap, 17% util, 26% tgt share
All of these are top 5 values
Upgrade at QB, no pass catching help
not counting Amari Cooper
No reason to not have a monster year",,,,
3,Lamar Jackson,"Lamar Jackson was a beast last year, leading the league in rushing yards among QBs while also throwing 41 TDs. This will likely be the best passing season we'll see from Lamar, so expect some passing regression. Rushing upside is still strong as ever with Derrick Henry to keep defenses honest, solid top 3 option.",Saquon Barkley,"Saquon obviously had an insane season last year, but is unlikely to repeat it. 2k yard seasons are hard enough as is, much less back to back. While I do think this remains a run heavy powerhouse with plenty of opportunity for yards and TDs, I don't expect an overall RB1 finish from Barkley. Still a fantastic option though",Justin Jefferson,"New QB makes it a bit iffy, but did well with Darnold
30% target within 10 is great
30% target share is ELITE, Addison will miss time
Good defense lowers need to pass
Safe option every healthy year. 
Hamstring injury to watch, could be lingering",George Kittle,"Less util and lower tgt share, still elite
Even better pts/100 snaps
2nd most TDs usually sign for regression,
but WR room is still bad so could repeat
Less total volume, needs valuable passes",,,,
4,Jayden Daniels,"Jayden Daniels burst onto the scene last year, with the 2nd most QB rushing yards while still throwing 25 TDs (1 less than Mahomes). Aside from Deebo and losing Brob, the situation has stayed largely the same. Barring injury, expect another great year from Daniels.",Derrick Henry,"Old man Henry is bound to fall off eventually, but I'm not betting on it yet. Henry had ELITE usage within 5 yards, handling 95% of the carries there. Since I still expect this offense to be great, there will be plenty of TDs for the king. Maybe we see a few less big runs, but with Lamar healthy keeping defensive ends honest there will be room for Henry to have another RB1 year",Malik Nabers,"Incredible targets, 2nd in league (170)
Target share from 10yd incredible, 42%
Not many overall 10yd targets due to bad offense
QB situation at worst stayed same, likely better
31% target share incredible
Points per 100 snaps not as good, util very good
Massive overall WR1 potential, biggest holdback is poor offense",Travis Kelce,"Average pts/100 snaps, good util, great tgt share
Yes he's slowing down, but volume is still
massive for him. 22 more tgts than next guy,
3rd most targets
He will easily get top 5 on volume alone",,,,
5,Joe Burrow,"Typically, QBs don't break into this upper tier without some serious rushing work to back it up. The exception here is Joe Burrow throwing the ball 652 times, 70 more than the next guy up. While this is a number that screams regression, if anything the defense looks worse this preseason than it did last year. I wouldn't be surprised if he led the league in passing again this year.",Christian McCaffrey,"We all know what CMC is at this point. If he's healthy, he's likely the RB1 or at the very least top 3. If not, well, we saw what happened last year. Given his massive upside, he's falling towards the end of the first round. Ask yourself how comfortable you are with risk, and you have your answer on where to draft him. If you do, at least make sure to get Brob or Guerendo as  handcuff.",Nico Collins,"Good redzone target odds
Only ~8 targets per game
Incredible points per 100 snaps, high value targets
Good utilization rates, 20%
Great yards per catch, healthy season could be 1500+ yards
No Diggs, shld have a good share",David Njoku,"Great efficiency, 25 pts/100 snaps
Average tgt share 15%
When Flacco was in last time, he was great
With competent passing and health, he
should be awesome
37% tgt share within 10yds, great value
8.8 tgt/G is ELITE",,,,
6,Bo Nix,"Myself and many others thought Nix would bust last year. By the second half of the season, those thoughts were forgotten, as he grew in confidence and looked better every week. Nix also was sneaky good on the fround, with 430 rushing yards and getting 24% of rushes inside the 5. JK Dobbins could take some of that away, but I still see Nix with good rushing upside, both yards and TDs. The biggest thing hurting him now is a good defense that will keep him from truly airing it out, but he'll still be a solid play.",Chase Brown,"Once Zack Moss was out of the picture, Chase Brown was a machine. He lead all RBs in snaps/G in the second half of the season, while still having 33 PPR points per 100 snaps. 3.5 receptions per game is great, and we see no reason for that to stop. The Bengals made no major moves to strengthen their RB room, expect Chase Brown to be a workhorse RB",Amon-Ra St Brown,"Targets decreased year over year
Teslaa could eat even more targets
Incredible target share from 10yd, 35%
27% target share still good
Utilization a little low, points per 100 good
Offense could take a step back, not ideal",TJ Hockenson,"Came back from injury slowly last year
Average pts/100, good util, avg tgts/G
New QB could be good/bad, TE can be
safety blanket.
That being said, still risky to be this high",,,,
7,Kyler Murray,"Murray had a very up/down season last year, but still finished with over 300 points.While his situation has stayed largely the same, it feels like a ""take over or get out"" kind of season for Murray, and I still believe in the talent. The rushing floor will keep him a safe option, and if Marvin Harrison and Kyler's connection builds in year 2 as it should then passing should go up, vaulting Murray back into the upper tier of QBs.",Devon Achane,"Achane is a PPR machine, one of the best when Tua is healthy. The problem is Tua is never healthy, and Achane comes with some injury risk himself, already at risk of missing week 1. I think there are safer and better options available, but if he falls and you do get him be sure to grab Ollie Gordon who you can basically get for free.",Drake London,"Elite 29% target share
Second half worse for snap % + points per 100
Michael Penix not great at QB, Kirk wasn't good though
Not much target competition
Has a path to be a top 3 WR if Penix is decent",Evan Engram,"Good pts/100 snaps (25)
Snap share won't necessarily carry to new team
Could be 2nd in targets, at least 3rd
Should be good for PPR, good preseason",,,,
8,Dak Prescott,"Dak Prescott is a major sleeper this year. The Parsons loss puts Dak in a Joe Burrow situation, where he will have to throw the lights out to keep them in games. Add Pickens as a legit WR2 makes this passing offense a true threat. Barring injury concerns which seem to plague him consistently, expect a bounce back year.",Josh Jacobs,"Josh Jacobs had a good year, and what's better is the second half was better than the first. Snap % went up, utilization % went up, points per 100 snaps went up. This is a good RB on a good offensive team without serious competition. While he's a little lower because he doesn't have the same receiving upside others do (only 2 receptions/G) he's still likely to see 10+ TDs and a good number of yards.",Puka Nacua,"Not great tgt share, could be impacted by injury
Great points per 100 snaps
Great team WR target share
Poor targets from 10
Good overall targets per game, Stafford loves him
Davante could take targets, Stafford can be hurt",Sam Laporta,"Average pts/100 snaps, bad util and tgt share
Current ADP is a play on talent over stats
Last year for whatever reason was not as
involved as he was the year before
With no Ben Johnson, no telling this year
Too risky to be this high",,,,
9,Justin Fields,"While Justin Fields may not be a great real NFL QB, he's awesome for fantasy. Last year's half season has people forgetting that when he plays, rushing floor basically guarantees him a top 10 QB spot PPG, with upside for more. While I don't expect great passing to bolster his stats, I do expect his rushing to make him a viable start every week. Totally fine waiting on QB and snagging him late.",Kyren Williams,"Kyren Williams is a volume back, but he continues to get that volume each year despite ""split with Corum"" talks happening. 87% snap % is elite, and he gets 82% of the carries within the 5 yard line. While he's not super efficient and if a more talented RB steps up he could be benched, I don't see that happening the year he gets his big contract extension. Bet on Kyren to be a safe RB1",Brian Thomas Jr,"Only 7.8 targets per game, did go up towards second half
Snap % up second half to elite levels
Efficiency still very good but little lower second half
Low WR target share in Jax
Good 10yd tgt share, 9 total targets
Competition from Hunter, Strange. Lawrence not great",Dalton Kincaid,"Average pts/100 snap, decent util, bad snap%
If he could get on the field more he'd be good
6 tgt/G better than most this late
Talent is there, could easily break out",,,,
10,Patrick Mahomes,"Mahomes had a down year last year, and there isn't much reason for hope it will be different this year. Rashee Rice is out for 6 games, so Worthy steps in as WR1 while Kelce continues to regress. While I could see an increase in TDs just from Worthy taking a second year leap and Rice hopefully landing on his feet, there are other non-rushing QBs with higher passing ceilings I'd rather have.",Ashton Jeanty,"Most people are higher on Jeanty than I am, largely due to round 1 rookie RBs usually working out, but there's some problems here. This offense is not very good, and the line isn't great. While I do think Jeanty has the ability to finish as an RB1 (especially with the receiving chops people fail to remember he has from his time leading RBs in receiving in college 2 years ago), I don't think it's as safe a lock as people believe, making him not worth his current ADP for me.",Tyreek Hill,"Last year was a weird year. Massive dip in team WR
target share, went from >70% to <50%
Lost Jonnu, Tua should be healthy
Really poor efficiencylow target share and tgt/G
2 years ago was 1700 yard season, could snap back
This ranking is more gut-based. See him doing better",Tyler Warren,"Excellent in college, could be #1 or #2 option
QB situation less than ideal, Jones could
support decent but not great
Likely a lower ceiling with poor QB play, but
looked good in preseason, could rise quickly",,,,
11,Baker Mayfield,"Baker had a great year last year, and the situation this year is possibly even better depending on how good Egbuka is and how long Godwin is out. That being said, he had possibly his best throwing year last year and his current ADP has him at least repeating that. There are cheaper options that offer similar or more value.",Bucky Irving,"Bucky is an incredibly efficient RB, nearly leading all RBs in points per 100 snaps the second half of the season. His utilization rate is above 50% which is a good sign, although the snap share is still a little more. I do think there's more potential for Rachaad to eat some points here than people give credit for, but he is still a very talented RB that gets 3 targets a game and handles a majority of the goal line work.",AJ Brown,"Low volume passing team, 7.5 tgts per game
Lack of redzone targets not likely to change
23% target share not elite. WR target share not good
Much better target share second half
Utilization not great, points per 100 stats not either
Passing volume could go up, but relies on deep balls",Mark Andrews,"Great efficiency, but in this case it's bad
6 tgts inside 10, but 11 TDs
Only 15% tgt share, Likely is also there
Prime candidate for regression",,,,
12,Drake Maye,"Drake Maye has a chance to step up if Diggs can be the alpha WR1 many are expecting him to be. In between injuries, we saw flashes of a good QB with some rushing value last year. I expect Maye to improve and have a QB1 level season",Jonathan Taylor,"Jonathan Taylor has a great snap%, although utilization has gone down a bit. Only 1 reception/G means he needs plenty of TDs and yards to be valuable. While that is possible under Daniel Jones, if AR wins the starting job at any point JT very quickly becomes a middle to low-end RB2. There are other options I like more, but he is the end of a tier of safe RBs for me.",Jaxon Smith-Njigba,"Points per 100 snaps increase 2nd half, 26->36
Replace DK with Kupp, JSN still clear 1
Possible downgrade at QB, hard to tell
Great tgt share second half of season, 28%
Possible more zone runs this year
Likely still a good producer, maybe lower ceiling",Zach Ertz,"23 pts/100 snap, 18% tgt share good
low util + low snap not good combo
Good RZ tgts, 30% from within 10 yds
Low total volume makes it hard to pick
Will bust plenty",,,,
13,Justin Herbert,"Herbert could be a decent play this year, given the likelihood of increased passing due to the loss of Bosa on defense and a better WR room than last year. That being said, this is still an extremely run-heavy offense, so I expect multiple 1 TD <250 yard weeks.",Alvin Kamara,"Alvin Kamara continues to be a PPR cheat code in fantasy, racking up around 6.5 targets per game. With the dreadful QB situation, I don't see the high dump offs changing, and there still isn't much competition at the RB position. I expect Alvin Kamara to yet again exceed his ADP, barring injury.",Garrett Wilson,"As hard as it is to believe, downgraded QB
Wilson is begging for a better QB
Low efficiency, only 24
Talent is there, but the surrounding story isn't great
Clear alpha WR1, could have 30% target share
Catchable targets may still not be great",Tucker Kraft,"Not great efficiency, 17 pts/100 snap
Good snap%, really bad utilization
Could've already defined himself as top
target-getter and didn't. Unlikely to now
15% tgt share likely to stay similar
decent floor, low ceiling",,,,
14,Brock Purdy,"The WR room here doesn't look great, and CMC coming back means running should be the star of the show. The most likely outcome here is a slightly worse season than last year, where he'll have some good weeks based on matchups.",Kenneth Walker,"When Walker is healthy, he can be a beast. Great snaps/G and snap%, decent points per 100 snap but dropped off second half of season. Almost 5 targets per game at RB is great, and new coaching seems to fit the outside zone that Walker can excel at. Did have a less than great rushing % from inside the 5, but can succeed elsewhere. Would keep in mind Charbonnet as a handcuff if you go this route",Courtland Sutton,"One of, if not the best contested catch artists
Second half better, pts/100 snap 25 -> 31
Became Bo Nix's favorite target
Fantastic 5yd tgt %, 30% 9 total targets
If Bo Nix plays like second half last season, will smash ADP",Kyle Pitts,"THIS IS HIS YEAR… jk
Likely not going to be good again this year
Don't buy the hype here, stats are bad",,,,
15,CJ Stroud,"CJ Stroud lost Diggs, but has a healthy Nico Collins, Christian Kirk, and Jayden Higgins could be pretty good. Stroud has a little more rushing upside than people recognize, with over 200 rushing yards. Texans could easily look great on offense this year, and I'd expect Stroud to have a few good games.",James Conner,"James Conner is consistently underdrafted every single year. He was incredibly efficient last year, with over 40 points per 100 snaps, averaging 3 catches a game, and shouldered 65% of the goal line work. While there is talk Benson will take over the backfield, the same talk existed last year and he didn't. Benson is a nice handcuff, but Conner owns this backfield.",Ladd McConkey,"Points per 100 snaps decent, not awesome
Added Keenan Allen + Tre Harris, upgraded RB
Target share not great, 22.8%
Great 5 yd tgt %, but only 8 total. More runs
Don't love the lack of volume",Dallas Goedert,"Decent pts/100 snp, low snap% and util
Low total volume, ceiling is non-existent
When healthy high-end QB2 floor",,,,
16,Jared Goff,"Goff had the best year of his career last year, and I don't expect it to repeat. New OC, a difficult schedule, and what should be a better defense than last year all point to regression here",Chuba Hubbard,"Chuba was a surprise bright spot last year, with decent efficiency metrics but a great snap%. He managed 3 receptions a game and handled 77% of the goal line work. Carolina did bring in Dowdle, but I see him as more of a true 2 than a 1a 1b type situation. I don't think the offense will set off fireworks, so the ceiling here is pretty low, but Chuba can be a good safety valve that won't lose you weeks.",Davante Adams,"Still did well, older but still has some juice
Decent efficiency, better second half 30->36
New team so snaps/tgt/tgt share will be different
Should have plenty of targets if Stafford is healthy
Stafford loves Puka, will probably be WR2
Will be matchup nightmare, have many good games",Colston Loveland,"Super crowded room to get targets
People acting like Kmet is dead
Don't understand the hype here",,,,
17,JJ McCarthy,"JJ thankfully has another JJ on his roster that should propel him to some good games. While I don't expect greatness, I didn't expect greatness from Sam Darnold last year, and we know how that turned out. McCarthy had some rushing talent in college, but nothing to ring any bells in the NFL. I do think he should outperform ADP",James Cook,"James Cook was the definition of efficient last year. Unfortunately, a lot of this came from TDs, far more than we could possibly expect to see him get again this year. He managed 16 TDs while handling less than 50% of the goal line work, which is a major red flag. I'm happily fading this pick at current ADP",Tee Higgins,"Always has health problems, won't play 17
Great when played, 9.1 targets per game
Great efficiency, 35-38 points per 100
Great situation, just needs to stay healthy",,,,,,
18,Caleb Williams,"Caleb Williams has all the weapons to succeed, but also had good weapons last year and didn't. I don't buy that Ben Johnson fixes everything, and see him having some truly bad games.",Treveyon Henderson,"He hasn't officially won the starting job, but he had a great preseason and looked like one of the best rookies in the draft. With his receiving prowess and Josh McDaniel's offense he could easily see 3+ receptions/G, and could take over a good share of the running work from Rhamondre if he falls out of favor again due to fumbles or other circumstances. I don't think this offense will be excellent which limits upside, but could be a bright spot on this team.",Terry Mclaurin,"Just got paid, so no holdout
Decent points per 100 snaps, not great (28)
23% target share not ideal, especially with Deebo now
So much points from TDs, strong regression candidate",,,,,,
19,Trevor Lawrence,"The Jaguars have added Travis Hunter, and BTJ is now in his second year. Evan Engram is a loss, but Strange could be secretly good. I am hesitant to say Lawrence takes a step up, but I will say there is opportunity for him to have some good passing games. No rushing upside caps him though.",Omarion Hampton,"Omarion Hampton could be another case of rookie overhype. Najee Harris, while not eye-catching, is a solid RB given his eye gets healthy and will more than likely see 10+ touches a game. There is room for Omarion to take the starting job here and do well, but the ceiling is low. ",Jerry Jeudy,"Post trade had a breakout,
22 full vs 30 pts/100 snaps
ELITE snap %,  decent second half tgt share
Almost 10 tgts/G second half season
QB situation with Joe Flacco to start should be good
When flacco gets benched, we can hope for no falloff",,,,,,
20,Jordan Love,"Jordan Love has basically no rushing upside, which limits his possibility here. His defense, while losing Alexander, has gained Micah Parsons so is likely around the same or better if Parsons misses less games on average than Alexander did. This puts him in a similar situation to Mahomes, but with less talent both himself and in his receing corps.",Breece Hall,"Breece had a down year last year, playing a good amount of snaps but wasn't very efficient with them. There have been some troubling comments relating to the new coaching staff with Breece saying ""I'm not their guy"". I still think he starts and gets a majority of the work, but with Fields running more than dumping off I see his receptions going down, which was one of the only things keeping him afloat last year.",Marvin Harrison,"Horrible efficiency, 22.7 -> 18.2 points per 100 snap
Only 22% tgt share even though he should be top dog
Situation hasn't changlt,ed. Not sure last season was
his fault. Kyler should be slightly better this year, but 
nothing certain. ADP feels high",,,,,,
21,,,Aaron Jones,"The new fad is to fade Aaron Jones because of the arrival of Jordan Mason, but we are crowning a man without a full season of play the king of this backfield far too soon in my eyes. Aaron Jones exceeded expectations last year, and put forth a good performance with 3 receptions/G and handling 70% of the goal line work. I think Jones will see more usage than many predict this year barring injury, and will be a good RB2.",DK Metcalf,"Horrible efficiency, 21 -> 15 points per 100 snaps
Lost starting job to JSN, 19% tgt share
Far and away best WR on new team
Unfortunately means likely to get doubled
Will have some good games from Arodg deep balls",,,,,,
22,,,Isiah Pacheco,"When Pacheco was healthy, he was an RB1. Now having the whole offseason to recover, I see him taking over this backfield away from Kareem Hunt, who was one of the least efficient runners in the league last year. Pacheco doesn't get much receiving work, but if he gets back to his old self (which is likely given his age) we can expect good yardage and decent TDs from him. Another pro is the defense keeping them in pretty much every game, so he should have a positive game script most of the time.",Calvin Ridley,"Low pts/100 snap, 22.4. Good snap %
Awful QB play, Cam has to be better than Levis
Clear alpha option, no competition
Target share 24%, should go up
Tennessee will have to throw, should have good games",,,,,,
23,,,Tony Pollard,"Tyjae Spears is already hurt, and Pollard looks primed to start the season hot. Pollard was an all-around average player last year, which considering how awful this offense was is saying something. Given that I think this offense (while still bad) can't possibly be worse than Will Levis and last year, I can easily see Pollard reproducing last year's performances and potentially improving on them.",Tet Mcmillan,"Hamstring injury concerning
Should be WR1 on team that is getting better passing
That being said, Carolina is still bad
Bit of a flyer, could see some great weeks",,,,,,
24,,,David Montgomery,"Efficiency monster, incredibly high util % and points per 100 snaps
Very low snap % (41), only ~30 snaps per game
2.6 rec/G flies under the radar
Less than 50% rush % from 5, 12 TDs is over-performance
New OC, offense likely less potent, less room for TDs
Strong regression candidate",Mike Evans,"Mike Evans is Mr. Consistent, though we started to see signs of fall-off last year in the first half of the season when Chris Godwin took the reigns. Once Godwin went down, Evans efficiency skyrocketed. This year Godwin will eventually be back, and Egbuka will take away targets. We could finally see a year where Evans doesn't get 1k yards, and with that I have him falling just outide of my top 24",,,,,,
25,,,JK Dobbins,"New team so snap share is mostly irrelevant
Points per 100 snaps was great, 36 -> 39 second half
2.5 rec/G decent for PPR
Only 8 rushes inside 5, but 9 TDs. Still has some juice
If healthy, absolute steal at ADP. Should be much closer to RJ Harvey",DJ Moore,"Poor points per 100 snaps fueled by poor QB play
25% of targets not catchable
Training camp reports Odunze could grab WR1 spot
QB play likely still a problem, very crowded WR room
Good tgt share 26% will keep him in WR2 range",,,,,,
26,,,RJ Harvey,"Receiving upside, but JK should have starting job unless injury
Sean Payton loves to throw to RB, JK not the guy for that
Offense should be better, more scoring opportunities
That being said, JK likely goal line back",Devonta Smith,"Good WR on a super run heavy team

The situation in Buffalo hasn't really changed, Shakir is likely to be one of the primary target getters here. While upside is likely capped, he should serve as a good fill in most weeks.",,,,,,
35,,,Austin Ekeler,"Could be good value with Brob gone
Likely still 3rd down role.
Decent snap % but horrible utilization.
Despite low util, good points per 100 snaps. High value touches
Low ceiling, but reasonable floor for a fill in",Chris Olave,"Concussions + Horrible QB make this risky
Wasn't very efficient before injury, 24 pts/100 snap
Only ~5 tgt/G, not good at all
Kamara is the only thing I'd touch on this team",,,,,,
36,,,Travis Etienne,"Low snaps/G, low snap % and util. Awful points per 100 snaps
2.6 rec/G decent, but that's about it
22% 5 yd % horrible, no reason that will change. No TD upside
More likely to lose job than finish as RB2",Jakobi Meyers,"Before Cooper signing, this was incredible value
While not very efficient, ELITE snap % with good util
Plenty of targets without Davante
Now with Cooper and trade request, could be bad
Went from mid WR2 to high end WR3 at best",,,,,,
37,,,Tank Bigsby,"Low snap %, decent util, bad second half of season points per 100 snaps
Could win first down role out of preseason
Likely part of timeshare that results in nobody being relevant",Rome Odunze,"Horrible efficiency, 15 pts/100 snap
Good snap% but low utilization
Only 3.5 catchable passes per game
Training camp and preseason looks best for him
If Caleb steps up, could be good value
High risk, I don't buy the Caleb Williams improvement",,,,,,
38,,,Jordan Mason,"Backup, but paid decent money. Could imply 1a and 1b
Not great points per 100 snaps, low-ish util rate
Decent as fill-in for CMC, but low number of games before injury
Not many catches
Likely over-hyped",Josh Downs,"Favorite to be best Colts WR
Great success from slot last year, Jones will feed him
Great efficiency, 30 pts/100 snaps
27% tgts from 10, most targets on team
If AR wins back job, disaster for WRs",,,,,,
39,,,Javonte Williams,"Great snap %, horrible efficiency on low total snaps
3 rec/G good, but likely more to do with Sean Payton than ability
Less than 4 YPC behind good O-line. Not a good sign
Will likely start season as starter then lose job",Travis Hunter,"Subpar offensive team, stuck behind BTJ
Likely to see more WR snaps than DB
Could see Strange out-targeting him
Average for PPR",,,,,,
40,,,Dylan Sampson,"Think he will win starting job with no Judkins yet
Would rather take upside swing here than vets who will lose job",Cooper Kupp,"Hasn't had healthy season in years
Decent efficiency, 27 pts/100 snap with 2nd half fall-off
New team, will be WR2 behind JSN
If Dalton looks decent, can return good WR2 value
Likely low ceiling, decent floor",,,,,,
41,,,Rhamondre Stevenson,"Technically still starter, likely not for long
Fumble problem found him out of favor last year
Great snap % and high snaps, horrible points per 100 snaps
Goal line work kept him relevant, may not be enough this year
Will likely still hawk a few",Matthew Golden,"Training camp + preseason is good reports
High upside pick, Packers begging for true WR1
Love ""loves"" to spread ball around, will have bust weeks. If anyone wins WR1 job, bet on Golden",,,,,,
42,,,Ollie Gordon,"Ollie Gordon looks to have won the backup job over Jaylen Wright with preseason performance. Achane has already started to deal with injuries, and Ollie Gordon could be a serviceable backup. Ollie Gordon was one of the best RBs in the NCAA two years ago, people would do well to remember that.",Emeka Egbuka,"Will be very good for first few weeks with Godwin out
Betting on good enough to continue seeing work
Unfortunately is almost destined to have worse 2nd
half of season, but will still be decent",,,,,,
43,,,Quinshon Judkins,"Still hasn't signed yet, off the field issues + contract dispute
Crowded backfield, Sampson ripe to take the job
Super talented and could do well if signed, but no practice is bad",Jordan Addison,"3 game suspension not great, not horrible
Good efficiency, 30 pts/100 snap 2nd half of season
only 6.6 tgt/G, 4.3 catchable. Not enough for high level
High value passes, 9 targets within 10 yards
Hock should take more volume
Rookie QB won't support 3 great options, probably
not 2. Would bet on Hock before Addison",,,,,,
44,,,Cam Skattebo,"Starting season injured
Would have to leapfrog Tracy *and* giants would have to get better for him to be a good value.
Could see some TDs hawking from him",Jauan Jennings,"Good efficiency last year, 30.6 pts/100 snaps
Took over as de facto WR1, performed well
Some contract dispute, could cause problems
At risk of being overtaken by Pearsall
Late stage breakout, could be 1 and done
Would rather take Pearsall",,,,,,
45,,,Brian Robinson,"Traded to 49ers, little to no usage
Even if CMC gets hurt, could split with Guerendo",Deebo Samuel,"New team so hard to judge a bit, WR2 behind Terry
Injuries always a problem, was efficient before them
Will have a couple good weeks, benefits from lack
of talent surrounding him other than Terry
Low ceiling option",,,,,,
46,,,Joe Mixon,"Injury seems worse the more they don't talk about it
Chubb + Pierce could eat early season time
If injury isn't significant, will smash ADP
Good snaps/G, good %, great util and efficiency
2.6 rec/G decent for PPR, incredibly 5 yd run % (80)
Only thing pushing him down this far is injury, and end of season fall off
UPDATE: Out 4 weeks, avoid heavily",Jayden Higgins,"Interesting value here, I like as a flier in case he takes
the WR2 spot from Kirk, could be very valuable",,,,,,
47,,,,,Jameson Williams,"Decently efficient, 25->29 pts/100 snaps
17% target share is abysmal, now Teslaa added
Could see him losing WR2 job
Not worth the risk",,,,,,
48,,,,,Keon Coleman,"Keon Coleman should've broken out last year, but didn't. Some of this could be attributed to an injury he suffered last season, and there is hope he takes a sophomore leap.What does provide hope is Coleman had 5 targets within the 10 yard line, compared to Shakir's 2. If Coleman becomes a redzone target for Allen, expect him to outperform ADP.",,,,,,
49,,,,,Christian Kirk,"Christian Kirk is sitting in the exact same position Diggs was last year, but is being drafted far below where Diggs was. Admittedly, the talent gap is there, but probably not enough to drop below some of the people going above him. While I would rather take Higgins on the chance he's more talented, Kirk will have some decent games.",,,,,,
50,,,,,Darnell Mooney,"Darnell Mooeny served as a decent bright spot for a few games last year, averaging over 6 targets/G last year. His efficiency wasn't all that good, but he did have elite snap share usage, and I don't see that changing. While I don't think Michael Penix is a great QB, if he does take a step up then Mooney is in line for good value.",,,,,,
51,,,,,Chris Godwin,"I love the talent, but the situation couldn't be worse
Injury will keep him out multiple weeks
Egbuka looks great, will earn targets
3 WRs to feed will leave 1 out, and I see it being the
injured one. Shame as he was crazy efficient when healthy, 35 pts/100 snaps",,,,,,
52,,,,,Michael Pittman,"Horrible efficiency last year 18 pts/100 snap
Big falloff, teammates picked up slack
Could win WR1 job but not my favorite
Daniel Jones likes to throw short, he's not slot",,,,,,
53,,,,,Wandale Robinson,"Most impressively bad season I've seen
10th in total targets, but only averaged 10 ppg
Don't hate as a late round flier in case volume stays",,,,,,
54,,,,,Rashid Shaheed,"While I do think Rashid has some talent, I don't share the same opinion of their QB room. I've already downgraded Olave because of this, I don't think multiple receivers can be supported in New Orleans.",,,,,,
55,,,,,Jayden Reed,"Jayden Reed has broken a bone in his foot, and likley is in line to miss some time. Reed was streaky last year, and didn't clearly differentiate himself from the receiving field. I like Golden to take over the field before him, and will be fading Reed.",,,,,,
56,,,,,Brandon Aiyuk,"Aiyuk is likely to miss at least a month to start the season, and I don't like betting on players coming back better from injury. With Pearsall and Jennings ready to compete at day 1, I see Aiyuk falling down the totem pole here.",,,,,,
